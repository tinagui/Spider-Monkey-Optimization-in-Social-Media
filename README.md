# ❀ Spider Monkey Optimization in Social Media ❀

### Abstract
		Implementing swarm intelligence (SI) in social media marketing is relatively new. As we know, swarm intelligence is a branch of artificial systems, which mimics the social behavior of neutral creatures such as bees, birds, fishes, monkeys, spiders and etc. Scientists believe emerging this new concept into social media marketing can be described as “Collective Wisdom”. In this work, we present an up-to-date study of the recent development and applications of swarm intelligence based optimization techniques in social media marketing, especially in the aspects of understanding the characteristics of social media users, studying their social behaviors, clarifying how the same interests can lead to the clustering of the users, and measuring the influence of very important person (VIP) users in the market.
